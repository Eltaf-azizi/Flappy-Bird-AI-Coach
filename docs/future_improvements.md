# Ideas

- Replace DQN with PPO/A2C for on-policy training and potentially faster convergence.
- Use image-based state (screen pixels) and convolutional networks.
- Add curriculum learning: start with large gaps, gradually reduce gap.
- Add a UI to show coach tips and training metrics live.
- Add tests and CI to run a short headless training session automatically.
