# Project Plan

1. Implement a playable Flappy Bird in Pygame.
2. Create a Gym-like wrapper so RL agents can interact with the game.
3. Implement a simple DQN agent and a training loop.
4. Build a Coach module that can either give hints or adjust difficulty.
5. Visualize training and evaluate performance.

Milestones:
- Week 1: Game core and environment
- Week 2: Agent implementation and initial training
- Week 3: Coach features and integration
- Week 4: Polish and documentation
