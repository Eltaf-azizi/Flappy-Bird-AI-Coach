An interactive Flappy Bird game with an integrated AI coach powered by Reinforcement Learning (RL).
The goal of this project is to learn RL basics, integrate them into a game, and create an AI system that can give hints or adjust difficulty to help players improve.


## 🎯 Project Goals

 - Learn the fundamentals of reinforcement learning.
 - Integrate game environments with RL agents.
 - Build an AI “coach” that adapts to the player:
   - Give hints when the player struggles.
   - Adjust difficulty dynamically for balanced gameplay.
